                    <img src="images/img2.jpg" class="img2">

                    Daniel Kahneman is an Israeli-American psychologist and economist notable for his work on the
                    psychology of judgment and decision-making, as well as behavioral economics, for which he was
                    awarded
                    the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (shared with Vernon L. Smith). His empirical
                    findings
                    challenge the assumption of human rationality prevailing in modern economic theory.

                    With Amos Tversky and others, Kahneman established a cognitive basis for common human errors that
                    arise
                    from heuristics and biases, and developed prospect theory.

                    In 2011 he was named by Foreign Policy magazine in its list of top global thinkers.In the same year
                    his
                    book Thinking, Fast and Slow, which summarizes much of his research, was published and became a best
                    seller. In 2015, The Economist listed him as the seventh most influential economist in the world.

                    He is professor emeritus of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University's Princeton School
                    of
                    Public and International Affairs. Kahneman is a founding partner of TGG Group, a business and
                    philanthropy consulting company. He was married to cognitive psychologist and Royal Society Fellow
                    Anne
                    Treisman.

                <h2 class="h1">Early life</h2>

                <p class="p1">

                    Daniel Kahneman was born in Tel Aviv, Mandatory Palestine, in 1934, where his mother, Rachel, was
                    visiting relatives. He spent his childhood years in Paris, France, where his parents had emigrated
                    from
                    Lithuania in the early 1920s. Kahneman and his family were in Paris when it was occupied by Nazi
                    Germany
                    in 1940. His father, Efrayim, was picked up in the first major round-up of French Jews, but he was
                    released after six weeks due to the intervention of his employer, La Cagoule backer Eugène
                    Schueller.The family was on the run for the remainder of the war, and survived, except for the
                    death of Kahneman's father due to diabetes in 1944. Kahneman and his family then moved to British
                    Mandatory Palestine in 1948, just before the creation of the state of Israel.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Kahneman has written of his experience in Nazi-occupied France, explaining in part why he entered
                    the
                    field of psychology:
                    <br>

                    <br>

                    It must have been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were required to wear the Star of David and to obey
                    a 6
                    p.m. curfew. I had gone to play with a Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown
                    sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a
                    German
                    soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform ,that I had been told to fear more than
                    others,
                    the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I
                    noticed
                    that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was
                    terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion,
                    in
                    German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some
                    money.
                    I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and
                    interesting.

                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Israeli intellectual Yeshayahu Leibowitz, whom Kahneman describes as influential in his intellectual
                    development, was Kahneman's chemistry teacher at Beit-Hakerem High School, and Kahneman's physiology
                    professor at university.


                    Kahneman's paternal uncle was Rabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman, the head of the Ponevezh Yeshiva.

                <h2 class="h2">Education and early career</h2>

                <p class="p2">

                    In 1954 Kahneman received his Bachelor of Science degree, with a major in psychology and a minor in
                    mathematics, from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
                    <br>

                    He served in the psychology department of the Israeli Defense Forces, and as an infantryman. One of
                    his responsibilities was to evaluate candidates for officer's training school, and to develop tests
                    and measures for this purpose. Kahneman describes his military service as a "very important period"
                    in his life.
                    <br>

                    In 1958 he went to the United States to study for his PhD in Psychology at the University of
                    California, Berkeley. His 1961 dissertation, advised by Susan Ervin, examined relations between
                    adjectives in the semantic differential and allowed him to "engage in two of [his] favorite
                    pursuits: the analysis of complex correlational structures and FORTRAN programming.

                    <h3 class="h3i">Cognitive psychology</h3>

                    <p class="p3i">

                        Kahneman began his academic career as a lecturer in psychology at the Hebrew University of
                        Jerusalem in 1961.He was promoted to senior lecturer in 1966. His early work focused on
                        visual perception and attention. For example, his first publication in the prestigious journal
                        Science was entitled "Pupil Diameter and Load on Memory" (Kahneman & Beatty, 1966). During this
                        period, Kahneman was a visiting scientist at the University of Michigan (1965–66) and the
                        Applied Psychology Research Unit in Cambridge (1968/1969, summers). He was a fellow at the
                        Center for Cognitive Studies, and a lecturer in cognitive psychology at Harvard University in
                        1966/1967.

                    <h3 class="h3ii">Judgment and decision-making</h3>

                    <p class="p3ii">

                        This period marks the beginning of Kahneman's lengthy collaboration with Amos Tversky. Together,
                        Kahneman and Tversky published a series of seminal articles in the general field of judgment and
                        decision-making, culminating in the publication of their prospect theory in 1979 (Kahneman &
                        Tversky, 1979). Following this, the pair teamed with Paul Slovic to edit a compilation entitled
                        "Judgement Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases" (1982) that proved to be an important
                        summary of their work and of other recent advances that had influenced their thinking. Kahneman
                        was ultimately awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 2002 for his work on prospect
                        theory.
                        <br>

                        In his Nobel biography Kahneman states that his collaboration with Tversky began after Kahneman
                        had invited Tversky to give a guest lecture to one of Kahneman's seminars at Hebrew University
                        in 1968 or 1969.[5] Their first jointly written paper, "Belief in the Law of Small Numbers," was
                        published in 1971 (Tversky & Kahneman, 1971). They published seven articles in peer-reviewed
                        journals in the years 1971–1979. Aside from "Prospect Theory," the most important of these
                        articles was "Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases" (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974),
                        which was published in the prestigious journal Science and introduced the notion of anchoring.
                        Kahneman wrote the paper at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute.
                        <br>

                        Kahneman left Hebrew University in 1978 to take a position at the University of British
                        Columbia.
                        <br>

                        In 2021, Kahneman and co-authors Olivier Sibony and Cass Sunstein contributed to the field with
                        work on unwanted variability in human judgments of the same problem, what they term 'noise'. In
                        Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment, they write that due to factors such as cognitive biases, group
                        dynamics, mood, stress, fatigue, and differences in skill between assessors/decision
                        makers/judges, judgements that should ideally be identical in fact often differ a lot. This
                        gives rise to injustices, hazards and costs of various types. Furthermore, it does so in a way
                        that is distinct from statistical bias and which is affected by cognitive biases but not limited
                        to their influence. In the book, which received much press, they explain what noise is, how it
                        can be detected and how it can be reduced – which can also reduce bias.

                    </p>
                    <h3 class="h3iii">Behavioral economics</h3>

                    <p class="p3iii">

                        Kahneman and Tversky were both fellows at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
                        Sciences at Stanford University in the academic year 1977–1978. A young economist named Richard
                        Thaler was a visiting professor at the Stanford branch of the National Bureau of Economic
                        Research during that same year. According to Kahneman, "[Thaler and I] soon became friends, and
                        have ever since had a considerable influence on each other's thinking." Building on prospect
                        theory and Kahneman and Tversky's body of work, Thaler published "Toward a Positive Theory of
                        Consumer Choice" in 1980, a paper which Kahneman has called "the founding text of behavioral
                        economics.
                        <br>

                        Kahneman and Tversky became heavily involved in the development of this new approach to economic
                        theory, and their involvement in this movement had the effect of reducing the intensity and
                        exclusivity of their earlier period of joint collaboration.[citation needed] According to
                        Kahneman the collaboration 'tapered off' in the early 1980s, although they tried to revive
                        it.Factors included Tversky receiving most of the external credit for the output of the
                        partnership, and a reduction in the generosity with which Tversky and Kahneman interacted with
                        each other. They would continue to publish together until the end of Tversky's life, but the
                        period when Kahneman published almost exclusively with Tversky ended in 1983, when he published
                        two papers with Anne Treisman, his wife since 1978.

                    <h3 class="h3iv">Hedonic psychology</h3>

                    <p class="p3iv">

                        In the 1990s, Kahneman's research focus began to gradually shift in emphasis towards hedonic
                        psychology. According to Kahneman and colleagues,Hedonic psychology is the study of what makes
                        experiences and life pleasant or unpleasant. It is concerned with feelings of pleasure and pain,
                        of interest and boredom, of joy and sorrow, and of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. It is also
                        concerned with the whole range of circumstances, from the biological to the societal, that
                        occasion suffering and enjoyment.
                        <br>
                        In 1992 Varey and Kahneman introduced the method of evaluating moments and episodes as a way to
                        capture "experiences extended across time". While Kahneman continued to study decision-making
                        (e.g., Kahneman, 1992, 1994; Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993), hedonic psychology was the focus of an
                        increasing number of publications (e.g., Fredrickson & Kahneman, 1993; Kahneman, Fredrickson,
                        Schreiber & Redelemeier, 1993; Kahneman, Wakker & Sarin, 1997; Redelmeier & Kahneman, 1996),
                        culminating in a volume co-edited with Ed Diener and Norbert Schwarz, scholars of affect and
                        well-being.

                <h2 class="h4">Personal life</h2>

                <p class="p4">

                    Kahneman's first wife was Irah Kahneman, an Israeli educational psychologist, with whom he had
                    two children. His son has schizophrenia, and his daughter works in technology.
                    <br>

                    His second wife was the cognitive psychologist Anne Treisman, from 1978 until her death in 2018. As
                    of 2014, they lived part-time in Berkeley, California. As of 2022, he lives in New York City
                    with Barbara Tversky, the widow of his long-time collaborator Amos Tversky.
                    <br>

                    In 2015 Kahneman described himself as a very hard worker, as "a worrier" and "not a jolly person."
                    But, despite this, he said, "I'm quite capable of great enjoyment, and I've had a great life."

                    In 2002, Kahneman received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, despite being a research
                    psychologist, for his work in prospect theory. Kahneman states he has never taken a single economics
                    course – that everything that he knows of the subject he and Tversky learned from their
